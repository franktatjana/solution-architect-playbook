# Customer Proof of Concept (POC) Guide
A practical framework for planning, running, and supporting **customer-driven Proof of Concepts (POCs)** with minimal friction and maximum impact.

## Purpose
Many customers want to “try before they buy.” A well-run POC helps validate the solution technically and builds trust without over-investing or increasing risk.

This guide exists to help Solution Architects:
- Avoid reinventing the wheel
- Deliver consistent and successful POCs
- Reduce risk, effort, and ambiguity
- Align customer expectations with outcomes
- Document learnings and scale expertise

> **Note**: POCs are optional and should be used strategically not automatically.

## What You'll Find Here _(in progress)_

| [`02-workflows.md`](./02-workflows.md) | Information flow and team collaboration across pre-sale stages |
| [`03-questionnaires.md`](./03-questionnaires.md) | Reusable qualification forms for Observability, Security, and general POCs |

| [`05-checklists.md`](./05-checklists.md) | Before/During/After POC checklists to ensure nothing is missed |

## When to Use a POC
- The customer needs to validate key technical requirements
- A clear success metric is defined in advance
- You need to de-risk a larger opportunity
- There is a champion who will drive the evaluation

> ⚠️ Avoid POCs when there’s no clear definition of success criteria or valid use case, "no trying things out", it costs too much time and effort first of all for customers.
