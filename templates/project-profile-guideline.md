# Project Technical Profile – Guideline
A working document to capture key context, technical positioning, and account momentum for customer projects.  
Use this as an internal reference to stay aligned across touchpoints and track strategic progress over time.

## How to Use This Template
This is not a formal deliverable. Use it as a lightweight, structured way to keep project information clear and accessible:
- Summarize context, goals, and technical scope
- Track what was proposed and why it matters
- Highlight risks, differentiators, and value levers
- Keep it brief — this is for internal alignment, not customer review
- Update it as the opportunity progresses

### Project Summary
- Company Name: Brief legal name of the customer.
- Project Name: Internal or customer-facing project identifier.
- Date: When last updated.
- Project Link: Link to the opportunity or account in CRM.
- AE / SA: account executive and solution architect
