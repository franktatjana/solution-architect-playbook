# Solution Architect Playbook
A collection of methods, templates, and practices to support Solution Architects in their strategic and technical responsibilities.

## Why this playbook?
This playbook is here to make our work as Solution Architects easier and more effective. 

It helps us stay aligned, reuse what works, and focus on what brings real value to our customers.

## Playbook Goals
- Knowledge hub: central place for skill development and performance support;
- Customer success methods: initiatives aligned with business outcomes and long-term value;
- Best practices: consistent approach for discovery, solution design, POCs, and technical validation;
- Reusable assets: templates and guidelines to accelerate delivery and increase impact;
- Solution library: technical solutions mapped to business value
- Sales Alignment: technical activities linked to MEDDPICC and pipeline influence;
- Lessons learned: shared insights to improve future execution and enable continuous improvement

## Purpose & Vision
This playbook is designed to support Solution Architects in their day-to-day work and long-term impact. 

It brings together methods, reusable assets, and practical guidelines to help navigate complex projects with clarity and consistency.

The aim is to create a shared foundation that enables SAs to work effectively across teams, speak the same language with sales and product colleagues, and focus on what matters most to our customers.

At its core, this is a working document. It evolves with experience, feedback, and lessons learned in the field. Whether it’s about shaping a technical strategy, running a proof of concept, or preparing for a renewal conversation, the playbook should offer the tools and structure to get it right
